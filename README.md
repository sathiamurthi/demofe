# Introduction 
This project aims to serve BizOps users, managers, and employees. Employees can fill out timesheets for their allocated projects, and notifications are sent via email upon submission or rejection by their manager. Managers can view the timesheet data submitted by the employees working on the projects they oversee and can either approve or reject the submissions. A bulk approval functionality has been included as well. BizOps users can view clients, projects, allocations, bench resources, and reports on project status. - pls check if this ok or let me know if anything can be added.
